    People were always asking me, did I
    know Tyler Durden.

FADE IN:

INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

                TYLER
    One minute.
        (looking out window)
    This is the beginning.  We're at
    ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
    few words, to mark the occasion.

                JACK
    ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

                JACK (V.O.)
    With a gun barrel between your teeth,
    you only speak in vowels.

Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                JACK
        (still distorted)
    I can't think of anything.

                JACK (V.O.)
    With my tongue, I can feel the
    rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
    I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
    controlled demolition thing and I
    wondered how clean this gun is.

Tyler checks his watch.

                TYLER
    It's getting exciting now.

                JACK (V.O.)
    That old saying, how you always hurt
    the one you love, well, it works both
    way.
