    People were always asking me, did I
    know Tyler Durden.

FADE IN:

INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

                TYLER
    One minute.
        (looking out window)
    This is the beginning.  We're at
    ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
    few words, to mark the occasion.
