                JACK (V.O.)
    People were always asking me, did I
    know Tyler Durden.

FADE IN:

INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

                TYLER
    One minute.
        (looking out window)
    This is the beginning.  We're at
    ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
    few words, to mark the occasion.

                JACK
    ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

                JACK (V.O.)
    With a gun barrel between your teeth,
    you only speak in vowels.

Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                JACK
        (still distorted)
    I can't think of anything.

                JACK (V.O.)
    With my tongue, I can feel the
    rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
    I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
    controlled demolition thing and I
    wondered how clean this gun is.

Tyler checks his watch.

                TYLER
    It's getting exciting now.

                JACK (V.O.)
    That old saying, how you always hurt
    the one you love, well, it works both
    way.

Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                JACK (V.O.)
    We have front row seats for this
    Theater of Mass Destruction.  The
    Demolitions Committee of Project
    Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
    of ten buildings with blasting
    gelatin.  In two minutes, primary
    charges will blow base charges, and
    those buildings will be reduced to
    smoldering rubble.  I know this
    because Tyler knows this.

                TYLER
    Look what we've accomplised.
        (checks watch)
    Thirty seconds.

                JACK (V.O.)
    Somehow, I realize all of this -- the
    gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
    really about Marla Singer.

PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE
BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is
engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.

                JACK (V.O.)
    Bob had bitch tits.

PULL BACK to wide on...

INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.
Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."

                JACK (V.O.)
    This was a support group for men with
    testicular cancer.  The big moosie
    slobbering all over me was Bob.

                BOB
    We're still men.

                JACK
    Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.

                JACK (V.O.)
    Six months ago, Bob's testicles were
    removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He
    developed bitch tits because his
    testosterone was too high and his
    body upped the estrogen.  That was
    where my head fit -- into his huge,
    sweating tits that hung enormous, the
    way we think of God's as big.
